  "readme": "node-apac - Node.js client for the Amazon Product Advertising API.\n\napac (Amazon Product Advertising Client) will allow you to access the Amazon Product Advertising API from Node.js. It supports the newly required Request Signatures which can be a bit tedious to generate on your own. [Learn more about the Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html).\n\nnode-apac is just a thin wrapper around Amazon's API. The only intent is to take care of request signatures, performing the HTTP requests, processing the responses and parsing the XML. You should be able to run any operation becuase the operation and all parameters are passed directly to the execute method just as they will be passed to Amazon. The result is that you feel likely you're working directly with the API, but you don't have to worry about some of the more teadious tasks.\n\n#Installation\n\nInstall using npm:\n\n    npm install apac@latest\n\nIf you try to install without \"@latest\", it will try to install the most recent stable\nversion, but there is no stable version yet. So for now you must specify latest.\n\n#Quick Start\n\nHere is a quick start to help you get node, npm and node-apac installed and running:\n[node-apac Quick Start](http://www.synchrosinteractive.com/blog/1-software/39-node-apac-quick-start)\n\n\nHere's a quick example:\n\n    var util = require('util'),\n        OperationHelper = require('apac').OperationHelper;\n\n    var opHelper = new OperationHelper({\n        awsId:     '[YOUR AWS ID HERE]',\n        awsSecret: '[YOUR AWS SECRET HERE]',\n        assocId:   '[YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG HERE]',\n    });\n\n    opHelper.execute('ItemSearch', {\n        'SearchIndex': 'Books',\n        'Keywords': 'harry potter',\n        'ResponseGroup': 'ItemAttributes,Offers'\n    }, function(error, results) {\n        if (error) { console.log('Error: ' + error + \"\\n\") }\n        console.log(\"Results:\\n\" + util.inspect(results) + \"\\n\");\n    });\n\nResults are returned as a JSON object (XML results parsed using xml2js -- thanks pierrel).\n\n#API Documentation\n\nBecause we don't define any specific operations, we also don't document them. What a waste\nwhen you can find them all here:\n[API Reference](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/index.html?ProgrammingGuide.html)\n",
